# MagicMirror-Ubuntu

There is a lot of documentation out there describing how to run MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> on a Raspberry Pi. I had a few discarded Intel-based systems, with integrated touchscreen displays. These directions build the software using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. It was surprisingly easy.  I want the MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> to automatically start.  This being a general purpose computer, there are multiple paths to that similar end points.  Here is the path I chose.  I configured a normal user to automatically log in at system start and the MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> software to automatically start once that user logged in. 

I have two main requirements for my MagicMirror<sup>2</sup>.
 
1. Display background pictures, making it more of a MagicPictureFrame than a mirror.
   - The MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> runs as a normal user, with little need for elevated privileges. 
2. Retain the ability to run other programs, such as displaying video from security cameras.
   - My hardware is more powerful than a Raspberry Pi, so it should do more.
   - Part of this is to retain as *plain* an operating system as possible. Use only the available repositories from the vendor. Building packages from source, for anything other than the MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> and it's modules, will require manual maintenance for bugs and security fixes.
   - This should make it easy to configure automatic updates targetting security bugs.
     - Automatic updates that change or add features can cause problems. My first thought is that since this really only requires vendor-supplied Node.js, additional features and bug fixes shouldn't cause problems. 

## Todo
- I have to document the automated update configuration for Ubuntu.
- Test a build where the *magic* user was not created as a member of the *sudo* group.  Right now, the system is running well with the *magic* user removed from the *sudo* group.
  - Going through the history of the *magic* sudo commands, I don't see anything that required *root* privileges.
- Walk through installing MMM-BackgroundSlideshow.  That can be used as a template for installing other modules.

## Hardware

I have two systems, both have a Gigabyte N3060TN-EM motherboard, 32 GB SSD, and Intel Celeron N3060 CPU. Both have a touchscreen display. Both are in an all-in-one type configuration; the motherboard is mounted directly behind the display backlight. One system has 2 GB RAM. The other has been upgraded to 4 GB RAM and Wifi. Both displays are reflective enough that they could be used as a mirror.

## Random Notes and Observations

- I chose to try the two most recent LTS (Long Term Support) Ubuntu editions, 18.04 and 20.04.
- I avoided using Snaps to install the MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> software. I even went so far as to remove the snapd package from my 18.04 build.  In this case, Snaps is just **another** update mechanism that needs to be handled.
- The Ubuntu 18.04.5 build frequently hangs after a few hours, even when running on the system with 4 GB RAM. I did not troubleshoot the problem. The build on Ubuntu 20.04.1 doesn't exhibit this problem.  This could be due to my hardware.  It could be due to earlier package versions.
- I also tried installing on Elementary OS. It's based on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. The MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> wouldn't run, probably because this distro only comes with version 8.10 of Node.js.
- Interesting configuration option, delay automatic login.  The ability to delay the automatic login of the user running MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> could be useful. During that delay window I could log in as another user to perform other tasks.
- It would be nice to use some feature of the touchscreen to drop out of the MagicMirror<sup>2</sup>. Then I could drop out of the MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> to perform other tasks.  As I have things now, I need a physical keyboard to tap the ALT key.
- Something to think about: clone MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> to different directories, each with a different configuration.

## The Build

Instructions, so it can be repeated.

### Operating System, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

Installing *Minimal Ubuntu 20.04.1 Desktop*. The *Desktop* edition installs the window/display managers. *Minimal* to avoid unneeded software. When asked to create a user, I created my normal account, the one I use on all my Linux/Unix systems. We will create another user to run the MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> software and configure that user to automatically log in each time the system boots.

I am not a fan of the Gnome desktop, so I plan to try other distros that use something else. But, my opinion of Gnome3 may change with the version installed on Ubuntu 20.04. The virtual keyboard pops up when I touch the screen, making it easier to log in and perform tasks on the desktop. However, the virtual keyboard does not appear when MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> is running, so tapping the ALT key still requires a physical keyboard.

As a normal user preface the commands with `sudo`.  If you're logged in as *root*, **be very careful**.

- `apt install openssh-server vim screen`
  - I access the MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> via SSH often, including copying pictures to it.
  - You'll need an editor. I prefer `vi` over `nano`. Since I'm an old Unix guy, my muscle memory even perfers `vi` over `vim`. If you perfer `nano`, ignore all my vi(m) reconfigurations.
    - Modify BASH environment: EDITOR and VISUAL.
    - Carefully modify `/etc/sudoers` to add this line.\
    `Defaults editor=/usr/bin/vi`\
     Then verify it works. 
- I do not configure NOPASSWD for my sudo users.
  - What little 
- By this point, I don't need `nano` anymore.
  - `apt --purge remove nano `
- `apt update`\
  `apt upgrade`
- `apt install sysstat chrony molly-guard locate`
- `apt install git nodejs npm`
- Create a user to run MagicMirror<sup>2</sup>.\
  `useradd -m -G sudo magic`
  - This gives *magic* the ability to use sudo. I'm fairly certain this account **does not** need this. It's on my list to run through the build again, but creating *magic* without this capability.  
  - Currently, the MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> is running well and the *magic* user does not have sudo capabilities.  I have another account to do operating system maintenance and know the *root* password should I need that.  There's no need for one more administrator account.
- `passwd magic` (Avoid the urge to use "mirror" as the password.)
  - Optional: Give *magic* a descriptive Real Name, so someone else will understand why this user was created.\
  `chfn magic` 
- Enable automatic login for that user. You have two options to do this.
  - ...<a name="autologin">through the Settings app</a>. This is probably the easiest method, but must be done as the *magic* user. We need to configure several other things as this user later, so you can delay this task.\
  `Settings > Users > Authentication & Login`
  - ...if using Gnome3: from the terminal, modify `/etc/gdm3/custom.conf`. (This option can be done either as root or as a normal user having sudo(8) capabilities.)  The `AutomaticLoginEnable` and `AutomaticLogin` lines are what we need to change.  See below for the context.

```
# Enabling automatic login
  AutomaticLoginEnable = true
  AutomaticLogin = magic

# Enabling timed login
#  TimedLoginEnable = true
#  TimedLogin = user1
#  TimedLoginDelay = 10
```

### MagicMirror<sup>2</sup>

Build MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> from source according to the [maintainer's directions](https://docs.magicmirror.builders/getting-started/installation.html#manual-installation). The node-js packages residing in the Ubuntu repositories for both 18.04 and 20.04 are sufficient, so no need to download and compile that. If the *magic* user has not been configured to automatically log in when the system boots, here is the opportunity to complete that.

**These steps are done as the *magic* user.** A terminal session is necessary for nearly all the commands I use.

- Login as the *magic* user.
  - If you haven't enabled this user for automatic login, now is a good time to use the Settings app and get this done. Refer to [details in the **Enable Automatic Login** using the *Settings app* step](#autologin) of the **Operating Systems...** section above. 
- Create and change to the directory you wish the MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> softare to reside.
  - For example, `mkdir Applications && cd Applications` 
- `git clone https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror`
- `cd MagicMirror && npm install`
  - This will produce error messages. Fix them if you can. My experience (Experience = Two Ubuntu builds.) is that MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> runs well despite the errors. 
- Modify the `config.js` file to your taste. The following command copies the developer-distributed example file to a working copy. (In case things are horribly botched, I can go back to the beginning.)
  - `cd config && cp -p config.js.sample config.js`
- You can run to see what happens. cd up one directory first.\
  `cd .. && npm run start`
  - Another page in the MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> documentation mentions using `npm start` I do not know the subtleties between the two commands. 

You should now have a full screen, plain vanilla MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> displaying the date and time, news feeds, and compliments. These default modules are in `MagicMirror/modules/default`. Any new modules should be placed in the `MagicMirror/modules` directory, i.e., you should `cd` to this directory before you run `git clone `*new-MMM-module*.

Any new modules will require a stanza in `MagicMirror/config/config.js`. Use your favorite editor for this task. Be sure to save a working copy of `config.js` before you make changes.

The US holidays are configured in: `MagicMirror/modules/default/calendar/calendar.js`
- You can modify the source to point at a personal web server, to include personal events. (I'll play around with simply pointing to a local file.) 

News feeds can be added in: `MagicMirror/config/config.js`
- While the *NY Times* feed is interesting, it produces a lot of headlines. I added other news sources, but they seemed to be drown out by the sheer volume of NY Times headlines.
- You can add more feeds. I found a lot at [Feedspot.com](feedspot.com). 

The compliments are configured in: `MagicMirror/modules/default/compliments/compliments.js`
- You can add your own compliments or even try something different. (Perhaps some science fiction movie quotes, because you never know why that watermelon is in the lab.) 

To deactivate a module, comment it from `MagicMirror/config/config.js` or remove the `{}` stanza completely. (Be aware of your commas!) I deactivated the compliments module by commenting out the stanza. I did nothing to the weather module, as I don't yet have an account on the weather feed site. (That's for another day.)  The MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> silently ignores this module.

## More Operating System Configuration
Modify the power settings to avoid screen savers, screen blanking.  Check if there's a setting for idle shutdown.

### Disable Screen Locking and Screen Blanking

You will likely contend with the operating system default settings for screen lock timeout and display power-down.
As the *magic* user.
- Set Blank Screen to **Never**.\
  `Settings > Power`
- Set Blank Screen Delay to **Never** and disable Automatic Screen Lock.\
  `Settings > Privacy > Screen Lock`


### MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> Start Script

You now have a system that will boot and automatically log in the user *magic*. From there you can open a terminal and run an `npm` command to start MagicMirror<sup>2</sup>. Let's write a script to do that for us. We'll reuse this script later. As the *magic* user:
- `cd`
  - This returns us to the $HOME directory. 
- `mkdir bin`
- `cd bin`
- Use your favorite editor to create `MM.start`. It should contain the following. Modify the `MagicHome` variable if you cloned MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> into different directory.
```
#!/bin/bash
##
## Start the Magic Mirror
## Usage:  MM.start [0]
## Start on local display or append "0" to start MagicMirror display via SSH.
##

export MagicHome=/home/magic/Applications/MagicMirror

if [[ $1 = 0 ]] ; then
  DISPLAY=:0
else
  DISPLAY="${DISPLAY:=:0}"
fi

cd $MagicHome || exit 1
( cd $MagicHome && /usr/bin/npm run start & 2>&1 ) | /usr/bin/systemd-cat -t MagicMirror -p info
```
  - There are plenty of ways to improve this script! 
- This is one of the few files that requires the execution bits to be set.\
`chmod 755 MM.start`

Since `$HOME/bin` is on the `$PATH`, typing `MM.start` from the command line will now start MagicMirror<sup>2</sup>. Go ahead and give it a try.

### Automatically Start MagicMirror<sup>2</sup>

Now we need to configure MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> to start automatically whenever *magic* logs in.

As the *magic* user, run these commands in a terminal session.

- `cd`
  - This gets you to $HOME, in case you were somewhere else. 
- `mkdir -p .config/autostart`
  - Yes, that directory name begins with a dot: `.config` 
- `cd .config/autostart`
- Create a `magicmirror.desktop` file. It should contain something like this. (Anyone have a good idea for an icon? *aeskulap* is leftover from the file I used as a template.)
```
[Desktop Entry]
Comment=Start the MagicMirror.
Name[en_US]=Magic Mirror Start
Name=Magic Mirror Start
Type=Application
Hidden=false
NoDisplay=false
Exec=/home/magic/bin/MM.start
Icon=aeskulap
Terminal=false
Categories=Viewer;Graphics;
StartupNotify=true
```
At this point, you can reboot and MagicMirror<sup>2</sup> will automatically start. 

There are other things that can be done.  Replace the Ubuntu splash screen with something more MagicMirror<sup>2</sup>-ish.  The same thing goes for the default background of the *magic* user.  As configured, it's the default focal fossa background.  During startup, the desktop is briefly seen.
